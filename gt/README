The files in this directory contain the lookup tables that NCL uses to
translate a grib table and parameter number into a variable name, long
name and units. In order for NCL to find these tables, you will need
to set the environment variable NCL_GRIB_PTABLE_PATH to point
here. Note that if you make any manual changes or introduce a new
variable, you will need to modify the grib_keys_cosmo.ncl file to
reflect these changes. Note also, that these tables can change between
the different COSMO model versions.
